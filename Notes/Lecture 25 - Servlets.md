- a **servlet** is compiled and is waiting as a **.class**
- Tomcat server will execute this **.class**

- if we are using a **JSP**, your web resource is NOT a .class 
  - it's a **.jsp** format which is like HTML and Java together
  - it's not compiled yet

## GET vs. POST





## HTML forms

- form is no longer HTML form; it's being generated by the backend program



- a Java servlet can detect if something is wrong in the form input

  - this error would display on a new page

  - so if we want the error to display on the same page, we have to repaint the page all over again

  - **THE SOLUTION:** when you have an error and forget to input a field, it's really a separate page that displays the error. So you need to generate the form as well as all subsequent iterations. 

    

- if a new HTML page is requested, it's like a book; it's flipped to the new HTML page

**If there are 3 images, how many HTTP requests does it take?**

- there are 4 files/requests to "paint the screen" (HTTP and 3 images)
- when the web browser opens up the page to render, it has to request for **each image**
  - then finally the page is assembled
  - it's the browser's responsibility
    - **Web server's responsibility is to respond as quickly as possible**
      - the server has 1000 people knocking on the door
      - reading and parsing the code to where the links



A web service is a servlet
