## Programming in Java (BUSIPS4007)

I took this course Fall 2020 and learned a lot about object-oriented programming concepts. The first half of the course was useful for solidifying foundational topics of computer science that I learned about from Harvard's CS50 but may not have fully understood the first time around. For posterity, I've renamed all the files to hopefully make it easier to navigate around my notes.
