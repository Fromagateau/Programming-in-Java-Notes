# Psuedo-code

To find the max number in a list:

- Create a variable and call it **max**

- Read first number

- Set variable to **max** to value of first number

- Read next number

- if no more numbers, print variable **max** and exit program

- etc.

  Breaking down pseudo-code more and more makes it easier to actually write the real code in **any language**

## Python Dictionary vs Java Map

- to count occurences of a word in a line

## Binary Search

- before doing a binary search, the list must be **ordered**
- if your index has 1,048,576 indices
  - it just takes 20 compares to find what it's looking for

## Bubble Sort

- use nested loop to create this algorithm

## Recursive Search

- binary search is a recursive algorithm (i.e. uses the same, repetitive instructions)

### It's important to be able to write algorithms in code by ourselves.
