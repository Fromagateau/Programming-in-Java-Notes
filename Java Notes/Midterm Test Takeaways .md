Watch out for this question which you got wrong; the correct answers are:

## **A, D, B, C**

- 1 can literally be stored in an int, a short, a byte... **it is not just an int**

- in Java, '1' would be **two bytes** as it's a char which is two bytes!

- ### C is a 4 byte pointer to a *2 byte char*
