- main() is a method that the JVM calls; you have the opportunity to pass parameters in main()

## Packing things into an array

- you make a **copy** when you copy a variable
- when you do that with an object, you **get a reference**
- when you copy a priminative data-type into an array, you get two arrays; you're not changing the original array
- to actually change a string in an array, it needs to be a **string buffer**

---

**for any method that is a static method--you put the class name in front of it**

- If you create an array with 10 elements and **need more**, you **cannot extend this array once you've created it**
  - you could **very easily copy that array to a new array with a new length**

---

**In order to do a binary search, the list must be sorted**

---

- **the .join() method**
- **instance methods use the object name, whereas static methods use the class name**

## Data Stuctures

- way to pack your information
- tuple is like a list, but immutable

### ArrayList

---

- Part of Java's collection classes
- arrays do not grow automatically, **ArrayLists do**
- elements can be different types
- does not take primitive data-types
