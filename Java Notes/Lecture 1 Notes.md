* Will download a Java JDK on Friday (or before)
* JavaTester on teacher's website is used to compile code on web

#lecture 

*1st Generation Languages:*

-low level machine code
-one-to-one instructions to CPU
ex. 5A 0001 0002

*2nd Generation Languages:*

-Assembler-code, ALMOST 1-1 translation
-it preceded the languages we use today

ex. ADD R1,R2 (R1 is register 1, etc.)

—assembler code is slower because it has to be translated, because we are further from the machine than 1st Generation languages

*3rd Generation Languages:*

* more English like (C, C++, Java, etc.)
* A program is a series of high-level instructions
* Each piece of code gets translated into multiple lines of machine code which is why it’s easier for us. It takes care of the heavy-lifting
* Programs must be compiled or interpreted (compiler vs. interpreter)
* ex. C = A + B

*4th Generation Language (slightly above 3rd Gen. languages):*

* Like SQL (declarative language) because we let the database server write the code
* We use commands
* They are not procedural
* Requires an interpreter or code generator to generate appropriate low-level code
* Thus, it still is getting translated into machine-code
* ex. sum(income)

3000 or 4000 lines of code in a 3rd generation language are taken and translated into machine-level or assembler-level code. The OS understands ON or OFF

* The OS really only understands about 75 to 125 or so instructions
* It was built to understand these instructions
* Microsoft OS and Apple OS understand DIFFERENT instructions

* Examples of these instructions: add, sub, mov, jump, amp, or, and
* Each “Op-code” like 00, 28, 88, E9, 38, etc. is a different instruction (simple machine instructions)

Compiler vs interpreter
* Why is it necessary to know?
* Java is a HYBRID (compiled AND interpreted)
* Will find out on Friday about this!
* Read SESSION NO. 2 which explains how to download and install a Java compiler and a Java interpreter
COMPILER:
*  C, C++, Objective-C, Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, PL1…

INTERPRETER:	

* Python, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, Ruby
